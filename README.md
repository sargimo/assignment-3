# Cool Star Wars Title (pew pew)

Hello! Welcome to our single-page web application promoting a super cool new Star Wars movie. 

This project constitutes part of our course at [YooBee School of Design](https://www.yoobee.ac.nz/); as such it is purely for educational purposes, but if you are into it then by all means [get involved](https://github.com/jkilmartin/StarwarsVueStyleGuide/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Tech
The project uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) framework and the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.co/). 
We use [vue-resource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-resource) for requests and responses and [vue-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router) to handle page routing.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is installed to handle styling and interactions (but does not have to be used exclusively).
Please follow best practices and the conventions outlined in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/jkilmartin/StarwarsVueStyleGuide/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).
